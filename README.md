# Analyzing the Impact of Automatic Dependency Management in Serverless Computing

This repository contains my graduate research paper and supporting materials on the security implications of automatic dependency management in serverless cloud environments.  
**Project completed for: Large Scale System Security (690G), UMass Amherst, Spring 2024.**

## Overview

As serverless architectures like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions become more popular, automatic dependency management tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) are increasingly used to keep cloud applications secure and up to date.  
However, these automation tools introduce new security and operational challenges. This research project analyzes the benefits, risks, and real-world developer experiences with automatic dependency management in serverless computing.

## Key Contributions

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Evaluated how AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure handle dependency management and security, including platform integrations with Snyk, Dependabot, and other automated tools.
- **Survey & Developer Insights:**  
  Designed and distributed a developer survey (n=14), collecting data on real-world experiences, tool usage, and perceived risks/benefits of automated dependency management in serverless environments.
- **Security Findings:**  
  Identified critical security risks—such as version conflicts, hidden vulnerabilities, and the challenge of transparency and vendor lock-in in automated tools.
- **Recommendations:**  
  Offered actionable best practices, including stronger developer education, transparency in automation, and enhanced monitoring.

## Abstract

> Serverless architectures have gained significant traction for their scalability and ease of deployment, but automatic dependency management introduces unique security challenges. This study analyzes the security implications of dependency automation in serverless computing, reviews tools like Snyk and Dependabot, and surveys real-world developer practices. Findings highlight key risks, best practices, and areas for improvement to help secure the next generation of cloud-native applications.
